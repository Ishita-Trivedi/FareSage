# FareSage: Flight Price Prediction Model

**FareSage** is a flight price prediction model that uses a **Random Forest Regressor** to forecast flight prices based on various features such as departure time, source city, destination city, airline, number of stops, and more. This model helps in predicting the price of flights, which can be useful for travel agencies, airline companies, or individual travelers looking for better fare insights.

## About

FareSage uses **Random Forest Regressor** from scikit-learn to predict flight prices. The dataset used contains various features that can affect flight prices such as the source city, destination city, airline, number of stops, and more. The model is trained on this dataset, and it can predict the price for a new set of inputs based on these features.

## Features

- **Predict flight prices** based on multiple factors such as city, airline, departure time, stops, etc.
- Utilizes **Random Forest Regressor** for high accuracy and handling of complex relationships between features.
- Can be easily integrated into travel platforms for dynamic price predictions.

## Installation
